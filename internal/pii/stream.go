// delivers restored content to the client token-by-token as soon as it is
// safe to do so — that is, as soon as the carry buffer cannot be the start of
// a known pseudonym.
//
// Pseudonyms are exactly pseudonymLen (31) bytes and begin with pseudonymMarker
// ("PII_"). The restorer maintains a per-choice carry buffer of at most
// pseudonymLen-1 bytes. A byte is emitted only when the longest suffix of the
// carry that is a proper prefix of ANY known pseudonym has length L, making the
// first len(carry)-L bytes safe to emit.

// # Guarantee precision
//
// The client never receives a canonical/exact pseudonym (PII_<2 alnum>_<24
// hex>). A sub-canonical PII_-prefixed fragment in free CONTENT (e.g. "PII_X")
// may pass through: it is not a restorable pseudonym and failing closed would
// abort on natural text containing "PII_". Such fragments carry no PII — they
// are opaque character sequences that were never inserted by the anonymizer. In
// tool-call arguments, even sub-canonical PII_-prefixed fragments are
// fail-closed because tool arguments must contain only structured data (no
// natural text containing "PII_" is expected there).
//
// # Availability trade-off
//
// If the upstream response ends (via [DONE]) while any per-choice carry is
// non-empty, the restorer returns errCarryNotEmpty and aborts the stream
// fail-closed. This covers the case where natural content happens to end on a
// proper prefix of a known pseudonym (e.g. the response legitimately ends with
// a capital "P", "PI", "PII", or "PII_"). Because truncation is
// indistinguishable from a partial pseudonym at the stream boundary, the
// restorer cannot safely emit the held bytes. This is a deliberate, leak-safe
// design choice: the alternative — emitting ambiguous trailing bytes — risks
// exposing a real pseudonym fragment to the client.
