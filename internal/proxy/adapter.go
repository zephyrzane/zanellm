// body. Tool-call id and function name fields are not field-aware-restored;
// they are replaced as plain substrings. If a malicious or compromised upstream
// returns a function name or tool id that happens to match a pseudonym in the
// current request's reverse map, Restore would substitute the real PII value
// into that field and the client would receive PII in tool_calls[].id or
// tool_calls[].function.name. Rejecting pseudonym-shaped values fail-closed
// prevents this substitution from reaching the client.
