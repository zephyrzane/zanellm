# Changelog

All notable changes to ZaneLLM are documented in this file.

## [0.0.22] - 2026-06-21

### Features
- PII anonymization (opt-in, early/beta): structured PII (IBAN, email, phone, credit card, tax ID) in outbound prompts is replaced with deterministic per-organization pseudonyms before the request leaves to an external provider, and restored in the response, including token-by-token while streaming (message content and tool-call arguments). No prompt or response content, PII, or pseudonyms are ever persisted or logged. Structured detection is regex-based; unstructured PII (names, places, operator terms) is covered by the opt-in gazetteer below; transformer-based NER is planned. Off by default (#134, #135, #137)
- Gazetteer-based detection (opt-in): an in-process, language-neutral matcher catches unstructured PII the regex misses - names, places, company forms, and operator-supplied terms (customer/project/employee names). Curated German first-name and city packs are bundled; operators can load their own term lists for any language. No model/NER required. Off by default (#143, #145)
- Native tool-call support for the Anthropic and Gemini providers: OpenAI-style tool calls are translated to and from the Anthropic Messages and Gemini generateContent APIs across requests, responses, and streaming, including alongside the PII firewall (#138, #139)

### Fixes
- The PII firewall no longer rejects messages with `null` content (e.g. assistant messages carrying only `tool_calls`), so multi-turn tool conversations work with anonymization enabled (#136)
- Streaming tool calls are delivered more reliably: provider adapters can emit multiple events per upstream chunk and fail closed on a malformed tool stream instead of silently dropping a tool call (#144)

---

## [0.0.21] - 2026-06-19

### Features
- Usage analytics (LLM and MCP) and the audit log now resolve user, key, team, organization, and service-account IDs to human-readable names instead of showing raw UUIDs. Audit actor names are resolved org-scoped so cross-org identities are never exposed (#125)
- The in-app "update available" dialog now renders release notes as formatted markdown instead of raw text (#132)

### Fixes
- Documentation: the README and pricing pages now show prices in EUR (matching billing) and list usage export as a Community feature, and the README gained an architecture overview, a "who it's for" section, and a production checklist (#131)

### Security
- Rebuilt the published container image on patched Alpine (3.21.7) and Go (1.26.4) to clear base-image and toolchain advisories. No application code changed (#126)

### Dependencies
- Go toolchain 1.26.1 → 1.26.4 and Alpine base image 3.21.6 → 3.21.7 (#126)

---

## [0.0.20] - 2026-06-16

### Features
- Brute-force protection on the login endpoint: per-IP rate limiting plus per-account lockout after repeated failed attempts. In-memory, per-process (single-instance; distributed throttling will follow with Redis) (#104)

### Fixes
- Rate limiter now enforces each scope against its own limit. Previously the most-restrictive limit across key/team/org was applied to every counter, so an org or team was incorrectly capped at the smallest key limit and requests were rejected with 429 too early (#102)
- Users created via the admin UI now receive an organization membership and can sign in. User creation now requires an organization and creates the user and membership atomically; a guard turns the previous login crash for org-less users into a clean error (#100, #105)
- Profile password change now actually changes the password and verifies the current password first. The previous flow silently dropped the new password and reported success without changing anything (#99, #106)

### Security
- Audit log descriptions now redact sensitive fields (passwords, API keys, auth tokens, OAuth/client secrets) instead of persisting request bodies verbatim. A migration clears historical `audit_logs` rows that may contain such values. Operators upgrading from an earlier version should rotate any secrets that were entered through the admin API before this release (#103)
- Closed upstream dependency advisories in `react-router` (#111) and `vite` (#112)

### Dependencies
- github.com/valyala/fasthttp 1.70.0 → 1.71.0 (#111)
- react-router-dom 7.14.2 → 7.17.0 (#111)

## [0.0.19] - 2026-05-14

### Fixes
- Admin TLS configuration (`server.admin.tls`) is now actually applied in dual-port mode. Previously `tls.enabled: true` was a silent no-op - the schema and validation existed but no listener consumed the cert/key. In single-port mode (admin sharing the proxy port) configuring TLS now emits a WARN since external termination is expected there. Thanks to @martinsotirov for the fix (#92)

---

## [0.0.18] - 2026-05-13

### Fixes
- Startup panic when Code Mode is disabled - default config caused a nil pointer dereference of `SchemaTTL` in `app.go`. Thanks to @kernelb00t for the report (#87) and @SAY-5 for the fix (#90)

---

## [0.0.17] - 2026-04-30

### Features
- Code Mode response unwrapping — MCP ToolResult wrapper is stripped before results reach JS, so scripts work with plain values not protocol envelopes (#73)
- Code Mode output schema inference — return types are learned from the first successful tool call and persisted, surfacing as TypeScript via `search_tools` (#73)
- Code Mode tool descriptions rewritten with STRONG PREFERENCE / WORKFLOW / PATTERNS guidance to push LLMs toward chained calls and reduce sequential round-trips (#73)

### Security
- pgx 5.9.1 → 5.9.2 — SQL injection via dollar-quoted placeholder (low) (#75)
- vite 7.3.1 → 7.3.2 — arbitrary file read via dev-server WebSocket (high), path traversal in optimized-deps `.map` (medium), `server.fs.deny` bypass with queries (high) (#53)
- fiber 3.1.0 → 3.2.0 — cache middleware default key generator ignores query string (medium) (#77)
- postcss 8.5.x → 8.5.12 — XSS via unescaped `</style>` (medium) (#78)

### Dependencies
- go-oidc 3.17.0 → 3.18.0 (#67)
- fasthttp 1.69.0 → 1.70.0 (#70)
- golang.org/x/crypto 0.49.0 → 0.50.0 (#71)

## [0.0.9] - 2026-03-30

### Docker, Helm & Configuration

- **Fixed image registry** — Docker Compose now uses `ghcr.io/zanellm/zanellm`
- **Helm chart updated** — correct registry, MCP, Code Mode, and health check settings in values + configmap
- **Istio support** — optional Gateway + VirtualService templates (`istio.enabled: true`)
- **MCP servers in Helm** — static MCP server definitions via `config.mcpServers`
- **Example config expanded** — MCP, Code Mode, logging, health check, and enterprise sections

---

## [0.0.8] — 2026-03-30

### Performance

- **sonic JSON engine** — faster JSON serialization across all hot paths
- **In-memory caches** — MCP server lookups, access checks, and transport pooling moved out of the DB hot path
- **MCP Proxy overhead reduced 36%** — 670µs → 427µs P50 at 1000 RPS

### MCP Access Management

- **Closed-by-default for global servers** — organizations must explicitly grant access to global MCP servers (org-scoped and team-scoped servers are unaffected)
- **MCP Access API** — `GET/PUT /orgs/:org_id/mcp-access` (and team/key variants) for managing server allowlists
- **Org MCP Access tab** — new tab in Organization settings to toggle global server access
- **Team MCP Access tab** — restrict MCP access within org allowlist per team

### Benchmark

- **Go benchmark CLI** — 6 scenarios (quick, sustained, burst, large-payload, mixed, endurance) using Vegeta load testing library
- **Benchmark results** — LLM Proxy 442µs P50, MCP Proxy 427µs P50, Code Mode 3.35ms pure JS / 32µs warm eval

### Breaking Changes

- MCP access at org level is now closed-by-default. Existing installations with global MCP servers must grant org-level access via the new UI or API after upgrading.
- ToolCache is keyed by server ID instead of alias.

---

## [0.0.7] — 2026-03-29

### Code Mode

- **WASM-sandboxed JS execution** — LLMs write JavaScript to orchestrate multiple MCP tool calls in one execution (QuickJS via Wazero, pure Go, no CGO)
- **3 Code Mode tools** — `list_servers`, `search_tools`, `execute_code` on dedicated `/api/v1/mcp` endpoint
- **ES6 Proxy dispatch** — dynamic tool routing, any tool name characters supported
- **TypeScript type declarations** — auto-generated from tool schemas, injected at `tools/list` time
- **Console capture** — `console.log/warn/error` output returned in execution results
- **Per-tool blocklist** — admins block specific tools from Code Mode via API and UI
- **Persistent tool cache** — tool schemas stored in DB, zero HTTP calls on startup, 24h background refresh
- **Execution history** — UUIDv7 per execution groups tool calls for tracing
- **SSE transport detection** — deprecated SSE servers auto-detected and deactivated
- **MCP server split** — Code Mode at `/api/v1/mcp`, management tools at `/api/v1/mcp/zanellm`
- **Tools list UI** — expanded row shows all tools per server with block/unblock buttons
- **Code Mode toggle** — per-server enable/disable in UI and API
- **Refresh tools endpoint** — force re-fetch tool schemas with 60s cooldown

---

## [0.0.6] — 2026-03-28

### MCP Gateway

- **Built-in MCP server** — 6 management tools (list_models, get_model_health, get_usage, list_keys, create_key, list_deployments)
- **MCP Gateway proxy** — register external MCP servers, proxy tool calls with auth and access control
- **Scoped access control** — global, org, and team-level MCP server registration
- **MCP access tables** — org/team/key allowlists (most-restrictive-wins)
- **Session management** — auto-initialize, Mcp-Session-Id forwarding, session re-init on expiry
- **YAML config sync** — MCP servers from `zanellm.yaml` synced to DB at startup
- **Async tool call logging** — fire-and-forget batch writes to `mcp_tool_calls`
- **MCP Servers UI** — CRUD, scope selector, auth type tabs, test connection, source badges
- **Prometheus metrics** — tool call counts, duration, transport errors

---

## [0.0.5] — 2026-03-26
