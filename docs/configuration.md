# Configuration Reference

ZaneLLM is configured via a YAML file. By default it looks for `zanellm.yaml` in the current directory, or pass `--config /path/to/config.yaml`.

Environment variables are interpolated with `${VAR}` syntax. Use this for secrets:

```yaml
settings:
  admin_key: ${ZANELLM_ADMIN_KEY}
  encryption_key: ${ZANELLM_ENCRYPTION_KEY}
```

## Server

```yaml
server:
  proxy:
    port: 8080              # Proxy port — LLM clients connect here
    read_timeout: 30s
    write_timeout: 120s     # High for streaming responses
    idle_timeout: 60s
    drain_timeout: 25s      # Graceful shutdown drain window (5s–120s)

  # Optional: separate admin port for UI + Admin API
  admin:
    port: 0                 # 0 = everything on proxy port (default)
    tls:
      enabled: false
      cert: /certs/tls.crt
      key: /certs/tls.key
```

## Database

```yaml
database:
  driver: sqlite            # sqlite (default) or postgres
  dsn: /data/zanellm.db    # SQLite file path or PostgreSQL DSN

  # PostgreSQL example:
  # driver: postgres
  # dsn: postgres://user:${DB_PASSWORD}@host:5432/zanellm?sslmode=require

  # Connection pool (PostgreSQL only)
  max_open_conns: 25
  max_idle_conns: 5
  conn_max_lifetime: 5m
```

For config-less startup (no YAML file), these environment variables override the defaults:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ZANELLM_DATABASE_DSN` | `./zanellm.db` (standalone), `/data/zanellm.db` (Docker) | Database file path or PostgreSQL DSN |
| `ZANELLM_DATABASE_DRIVER` | `sqlite` | Database driver - `sqlite` or `postgres` |

## Models

```yaml
models:
  - name: dolphin-mistral         # Unique model name
    provider: ollama              # openai, anthropic, azure, vllm, ollama, custom
    base_url: http://localhost:11434/v1
    api_key: ${OLLAMA_KEY}        # Optional, depends on provider
    timeout: 30s                  # Per-model upstream timeout (default: 5min)
    aliases:                      # Alternative names clients can use
      - dolphin
      - default
    max_context_tokens: 32000     # Informational, shown in UI
    pricing:
      input_per_1m: 0.15         # Cost per 1M input tokens (for usage tracking)
      output_per_1m: 0.60

  # Azure requires deployment name + API version
  - name: gpt-4o
    provider: azure
    base_url: https://mycompany.openai.azure.com
    api_key: ${AZURE_KEY}
    azure_deployment: my-gpt4o-deployment   # your Azure deployment name, not the model name
    azure_api_version: "2024-10-21"
```

Models can also be created via the Admin API and stored in the database.
DB models take precedence over YAML models on name collision.

## Load Balancing

Models can have multiple deployments for redundancy and load distribution. ZaneLLM routes requests across deployments and automatically falls back on failure.

```yaml
models:
  - name: gpt-4o
    strategy: round-robin        # round-robin, least-latency, weighted, priority
    max_retries: 2               # Default: number of deployments - 1
    aliases: [smart]
    max_context_tokens: 128000
    pricing:
      input_per_1m: 2.50
      output_per_1m: 10.00
    deployments:
      - name: azure-east
        provider: azure
        base_url: https://eastus.openai.azure.com
        api_key: ${AZURE_EAST_KEY}
        azure_deployment: my-gpt4o-deployment   # your Azure deployment name, not the model name
        weight: 2                # For weighted strategy
        priority: 1              # For priority strategy (lower = higher)
      - name: azure-west
        provider: azure
        base_url: https://westus.openai.azure.com
        api_key: ${AZURE_WEST_KEY}
        azure_deployment: my-gpt4o-deployment   # your Azure deployment name, not the model name
        weight: 1
        priority: 2
      - name: openai-fallback
        provider: openai
        base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
        api_key: ${OPENAI_KEY}
        weight: 1
        priority: 3
```

**Strategies:**

| Strategy | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `round-robin` | Rotate through healthy deployments (default) |
| `least-latency` | Route to deployment with lowest measured latency |
| `weighted` | Random selection weighted by `weight` field |
| `priority` | Ordered fallback — try lowest priority number first |

**Retry behavior:**
- 5xx, timeout, connection refused → automatic retry to next deployment
- 4xx → return error immediately (client error, retrying won't help)
- Once streaming has started → no retry (committed to the deployment)

**Health integration:** The health checker probes each deployment independently. Unhealthy deployments are skipped during routing. If all deployments are unhealthy, ZaneLLM tries all of them as a last resort.

**Circuit breakers:** Each deployment has its own circuit breaker. After repeated failures a deployment is temporarily removed from rotation and automatically recovers.

## MCP

ZaneLLM is an MCP Gateway — it exposes built-in management tools and proxies requests to external MCP servers with access control, usage tracking, and session management.

### Built-in ZaneLLM Tools

The built-in MCP server at `/api/v1/mcp/zanellm` provides management tools for IDE integration.

| Tool | Description | Min Role |
|---|---|---|
| `list_models` | Models with health. Admin sees strategy/deployments, member sees name/type only | member |
| `get_model_health` | Per-model or per-deployment health status | member |
| `get_usage` | Usage stats scoped to caller's key/org | member |
| `list_keys` | API keys. Member sees own, admin sees all | member |
| `create_key` | Create API key with optional expiry | member |
| `list_deployments` | Deployment details for a model | system_admin |

### External MCP Servers

Register external MCP servers (GitHub, Zapier, custom tools) and proxy requests through ZaneLLM. Access any registered server via `/api/v1/mcp/:alias`.

**Scoping:** MCP servers can be registered at three levels:

| Scope | Created by | Visible to |
|---|---|---|
| Global | system_admin | All orgs (via access control) |
| Organization | org_admin | Members of that org |
| Team | team_admin | Members of that team |

**Session management:** ZaneLLM automatically handles MCP sessions with upstream servers. On the first request, ZaneLLM sends `initialize` to the upstream, stores the `Mcp-Session-Id`, and includes it on all subsequent requests. Expired sessions (404) trigger automatic re-initialization with a single retry. Sessions are per ZaneLLM instance, in-memory only.

**Alias shadowing:** A team-scoped server with alias "github" takes priority over an org-scoped or global server with the same alias. Resolution order: team → org → global.

### Endpoints

```
POST /api/v1/mcp/:alias                — Proxy JSON-RPC to any registered MCP server
GET  /api/v1/mcp/:alias                — SSE stream (built-in zanellm server only)

POST /api/v1/mcp-servers               — Register global server (system_admin)
GET  /api/v1/mcp-servers               — List global servers (system_admin)
POST /api/v1/orgs/:id/mcp-servers      — Register org-scoped server (org_admin)
GET  /api/v1/orgs/:id/mcp-servers      — List org + global servers (member)
POST /api/v1/orgs/:id/teams/:id/mcp-servers  — Register team-scoped server (team_admin)
GET  /api/v1/orgs/:id/teams/:id/mcp-servers  — List team + org + global servers (member)
```

### Protocol

JSON-RPC 2.0 over Streamable HTTP (MCP spec version `2025-03-26`). Supports both `application/json` and `text/event-stream` response formats. Authentication via standard ZaneLLM Bearer token.

### IDE Setup (Claude Code / Cursor)

Built-in ZaneLLM tools:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zanellm": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://your-zanellm-instance/api/v1/mcp/zanellm",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer vl_uk_your_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

External server via ZaneLLM proxy:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://your-zanellm-instance/api/v1/mcp/github",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer vl_uk_your_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration

```yaml
settings:
  mcp:
    call_timeout: 30s            # Max duration per proxied tool call (default: 30s)
    allow_private_urls: false     # Allow localhost/private IPs for MCP server URLs
    health:
      enabled: true              # Enable MCP server health probing (default: true)
      interval: 60s              # Probe interval (default: 60s)

mcp_servers:
  - name: GitHub
    alias: github
    url: https://mcp.github.com/sse
    auth_type: bearer
    auth_token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

MCP servers declared here are synced to the database at startup with `source: yaml`. Servers created via the Admin API (`source: api`) are never overwritten by YAML entries.

### Privacy

MCP tool call arguments and results are not logged or stored. Only metadata is tracked: who called which tool on which server, duration, and status. Consistent with ZaneLLM's zero-knowledge architecture.

### Metrics

```
zanellm_mcp_tool_calls_total{server, tool, status}
zanellm_mcp_tool_call_duration_seconds{server, tool}
zanellm_mcp_transport_errors_total{server, error_type}
```

## Settings

```yaml
settings:
  # Required: bootstrap admin key (≥32 chars)
  admin_key: ${ZANELLM_ADMIN_KEY}

  # Required: AES-256-GCM encryption key (base64, 32 bytes)
  # Generate: openssl rand -base64 32
  encryption_key: ${ZANELLM_ENCRYPTION_KEY}

  # Enterprise license key
  license: ${ZANELLM_LICENSE}
  # Or as a file path:
  # license_file: /etc/zanellm/license.jwt

  # First-run bootstrap
  bootstrap:
    org_name: "My Company"
    org_slug: "my-company"          # Auto-derived from name if empty
    admin_email: "admin@company.com"

  # Usage logging
  usage:
    buffer_size: 1000               # Events buffered before flush
    flush_interval: 5s
    drop_on_full: true              # Drop events when buffer full (never blocks proxy)

  # Token counting
  token_counting:
    enabled: true

  # Soft limit warning threshold
  soft_limit_threshold: 0.9        # Warn at 90% of limit
```

## Cache

```yaml
cache:
  key_ttl: 30s              # How often to refresh the key cache from DB
  model_ttl: 60s            # Model access cache refresh
  alias_ttl: 60s            # Alias cache refresh
```

## Circuit Breaker

Per-model circuit breaker for upstream provider errors. When a model's upstream
returns consecutive failures, the circuit opens and requests are rejected
immediately — preventing cascading failures.

```yaml
settings:
  circuit_breaker:
    enabled: false
    threshold: 5             # Consecutive failures before circuit opens
    timeout: 30s             # How long circuit stays open
    half_open_max: 1         # Probe requests in half-open state
```

## Enterprise Features

The following features require a license key. See the
[Enterprise documentation](enterprise/license.md) for setup instructions.

### Redis (Enterprise)

Required for multi-instance deployments. Enables distributed rate limiting
and instant cache invalidation across instances. Single-instance deployments
don't need Redis.

```yaml
redis:
  enabled: false
  url: redis://:${REDIS_PASSWORD}@redis:6379/0
  key_prefix: zanellm:
```

### Audit Logging (Enterprise)

Requires a license with the `audit_logs` feature.

```yaml
settings:
  audit:
    enabled: true
    buffer_size: 500
    flush_interval: 5s
```

### OpenTelemetry (Enterprise)

Requires a license with the `otel_tracing` feature.

```yaml
settings:
  otel:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: "tempo:4317"   # OTLP gRPC endpoint
    insecure: true           # Set false for TLS
    sample_rate: 1.0         # 0.0 = no traces, 1.0 = all traces
```

### SSO / OIDC (Enterprise)

Requires a license with the `sso_oidc` feature. Global config deployed via YAML,
per-org config managed via the UI.

```yaml
settings:
  sso:
    enabled: true
    issuer: "https://accounts.google.com"
    client_id: ${ZANELLM_SSO_CLIENT_ID}
    client_secret: ${ZANELLM_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET}
    redirect_url: "https://zanellm.company.com/api/v1/auth/oidc/callback"
    scopes: ["openid", "email", "profile"]
    allowed_domains: ["company.com"]
    default_role: "member"
    auto_provision: true
    group_sync: false
    group_claim: "groups"
```

Works with any OIDC provider: Google, Azure AD, Okta, Auth0, Keycloak, OneLogin, etc.
