# Security Hardening

## Container Security

The Helm chart and Docker image include production security defaults:

- Non-root container user (`zanellm:zanellm`, UID 1000)
- Read-only root filesystem
- All Linux capabilities dropped
- No privilege escalation
- Resource limits configured

## Network

- **Separate admin port** - isolate admin traffic from proxy traffic:
  ```yaml
  server:
    admin:
      port: 8443
  ```
- **TLS on admin port** - for encrypted admin API access:
  ```yaml
  server:
    admin:
      tls:
        enabled: true
        cert: /certs/tls.crt
        key: /certs/tls.key
  ```
- **Network policies** - restrict pod-to-pod traffic in Kubernetes
- **SSRF protection** - ZaneLLM blocks connections to private/loopback IPs by default (configurable via `settings.mcp.allow_private_urls`)

## API Keys

- Keys are stored as HMAC-SHA256 hashes - the plaintext is shown once at creation and cannot be retrieved
- Upstream provider API keys are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
- Key rotation with 24-hour grace period (old key works for 24h after rotation)
- Session keys expire after 24 hours

## Encryption Key

The `ZANELLM_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is critical:
- Used to encrypt upstream API keys in the database
- Used to derive the HMAC secret for API key validation
- Changing it invalidates all stored upstream keys and API key hashes
- Keep it in a secrets manager, not in plain text config files

## Headers

- ZaneLLM uses explicit allowlists for header forwarding - only known-safe headers are proxied to upstream providers
- `Authorization` headers are rewritten per-provider (Bearer for OpenAI, api-key for Azure)
- No redirect following - prevents SSRF via HTTP redirects

## Checklist

- [ ] Use a strong `ZANELLM_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (min 32 characters or base64-encoded 32 bytes)
- [ ] Don't use `ZANELLM_ADMIN_KEY` as a production API key (it's for bootstrap only)
- [ ] Separate admin port from proxy port in production
- [ ] Enable TLS on admin port or terminate TLS at the reverse proxy
- [ ] Set resource limits in Kubernetes
- [ ] Use network policies to restrict access
- [ ] Rotate API keys regularly
- [ ] Monitor `/metrics` for unusual patterns
- [ ] Report vulnerabilities to security@zanellm.io
